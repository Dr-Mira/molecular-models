            "description": "Lisinopril is a medication belonging to the ACE inhibitor class, used primarily to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It works by preventing the body from producing angiotensin II, a substance that narrows blood vessels, thereby allowing vessels to relax and blood pressure to drop. It is also often prescribed to improve survival after a heart attack and to protect the kidneys in patients with diabetes.",

It works primarily by reducing glucose production in the liver and increasing the body's sensitivity to insulin. Unlike many other diabetes medications, it does not typically cause weight gain or a high risk of low blood sugar. Metformin is also being researched for its potential anti-aging and cancer-preventive properties.",

While its exact mechanism of action is still being studied, it is thought to work primarily by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis in the central nervous system. It is often preferred over NSAIDs for people with stomach issues or those at risk of bleeding, but it must be taken carefully as high doses can cause severe liver damage.",
